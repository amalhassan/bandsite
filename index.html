            <div class="about__container">
                <p class="about__content about__para-one">The Bees Knees is a pop rock band originating 
                    from San Francisco, California. The band 
                    consists of lead vocalist Bryan Teddy, guitarist 
                    Mack Tolkens, guitarist Andrew Green, bassist 
                    Kent Zulkee and drummer Freddie Fischer. The 
                    band achieved its first commercial success as 
                    an unsigned act, drawing attention from 
                    manager Cam Adams. Having worked with 
                    other popular acts (The Elephant In The Room, 
                    One Trick Pony, The Cat’s Meow), Adams was 
                    confident the band could succeed even further, 
                    pushing them to sign with Magenta Records. </p>
                <p class="about__content about__para-two">From there, the band has soared, gaining 
                    international recognition and ranking in the 
                    top 10 on the Poster Charts. New fans 
                    immediately fell in love with the band’s original 
                    and organic attitude, solidifying their place as 
                    one of the hottest and fastest up and coming 
                    acts of this century. Fans affectionately refer to 
                    themselves as “The Hive” and are drawn to 
                    their candid and authentic performances on 
                    stage. Looking forward to touring in the future, 
                    The Bees Knees are currently recording their 
                    second studio album, looking to be released in 
                    late 2021.</p>
